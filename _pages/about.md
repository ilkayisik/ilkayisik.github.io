Currently, I am looking for a new challenge that enables me to combine these passions in my work; preferably in an international team.

As a former researcher in the field of empirical aesthetics, I have experience in statistical modelling, machine learning, and data visualisation as well as presenting and communicating results effectively in a visually appealing way.
