I am Ilkay and I have an advanced academic background in neuroscience, psychology and aesthetics.

As a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, I have studied the psychological and neural basis of aesthetic experiences such as when a person is aesthetically “moved” by visual art or natural landscapes.

In my research, I used behavioural and brain imaging (fMRI) techniques as well as computational tools (e.g. Machine Learning, Deep Learning) and gained extensive experience in quantitative data analysis and statistical modelling.

I am an effective communicator and passionate about presenting results in a visually appealing way.

With up-to-date knowledge acquired during a recently-finished program on data science and data analytics, I'm well-equipped to solve challenging problems in the business and/ or research domain.
